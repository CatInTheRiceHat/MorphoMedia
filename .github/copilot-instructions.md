# Healthy-Feed-Algorithm Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
This Python project implements an algorithm for healthy feed optimization. The core components are:
- `main.py`: Main application entry point
- `data.py`: Data handling and processing module

## Architecture
- Simple script-based structure with separation of concerns between main logic and data operations
- Expected data flow: Data loading → Processing → Algorithm execution → Output

## Key Patterns
- Use Python's standard library for core functionality
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions
- Modular design with functions in separate files

## Workflows
- **Run the algorithm**: `python main.py`
- **Data processing**: Import and use functions from `data.py`

## Conventions
- File naming: snake_case for modules (e.g., `data.py`)
- Function naming: snake_case
- No specific linting or formatting tools configured yet

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x (no external packages currently)
- Future additions may include numpy/scipy for numerical computations
